#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The running time of problem a is O(n) because we are using a single while loop to iterate.


b) The running time of problem b is O(n^2) because we are using a while loop inside of a for loop increasing the number of operations with each iteration.


c) The running time of problem c is O(n) because we are using a recursive function.
