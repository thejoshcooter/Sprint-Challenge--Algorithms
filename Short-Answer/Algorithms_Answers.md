#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The running time of problem a is O(n) because we are using a single while loop to iterate.


b) The running time of problem b is O(n^2) because we are using a while loop inside of a for loop increasing the number of operations with each iteration.


c) The running time of problem c is O(n) because we are using a recursive function.

## Exercise II

// define a function that takes in an arbitrary number of stories as a parameter
// loop through the range of floors and toss an egg at each interval
// write a condition to check if the egg is broken - if it is then return that floor
// otherwise continue through the floor until the broken egg is true

The runtime complexity would be O(n^2) because of our conditional checks within a loop.
